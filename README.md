## Goal
We are motivated students with a goal of creating awsome games with Godot!

## Why Godot?
Godot is a powerful opensource game-engine which is easy to learn and compatible git out of the box.

## Membership
Currently any student motivated with any knowledge from Metropolia is welcome.

## Structure
We will first make simple games the first few months while doing practise exercises, then form small
groups and make a slightly bigger game. Finally make a few big games with a few big teams. What games to
make is up to the team.
